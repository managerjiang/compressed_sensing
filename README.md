# compressed_sensing
This project contains the simulation codes of 'Inexact Proximal Gradient Algorithm With Random Reshuffling for Nonsmooth Optimization'. This work considers the compressed sensing to recover the original sparse signal when the compressed signal has no, diminishing and constant errors.
